# EggSee

See what the interpreter can see. A helper to visualize why an import isn't working or a file isn't found.

### Requirements
- Python >= 3.6

## Local developer installation

It is **highly** recommended to use a `venv` for installation. Leveraging a `venv` will ensure the installed dependency files will not impact other python projects.

Clone this repo and enter root directory of repo:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/[name]/[module_name]
$ cd [module_name]
```

Create and activate `venv`:
```bash
# Linux/MacOS
python3 -m venv venv
. venv/bin/activate

# Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate.bat
# or
py -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

Your command prompt should now have a `(venv)` prefix on it.

Install editable library and development requirements:
```bash
# Linux/MacOS
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
pip install --editable .

# Windows
python -m pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
python -m pip install --editable .
# or
py -m pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
py -m pip install --editable .
```

Install pre-commit hooks to local repo:
```bash
pre-commit install
pre-commit autoupdate
```

Run tests
```bash
tox
```

To exit the `venv`:
```bash
deactivate
```
